###
EC2 Instance Filtering:

A query that can be used to perform near real-time analysis of the stats
for containers on a particular instance. This can also be further narrowed
by TaskId or ContainerName.
###

fields @timestamp, EC2InstanceId
| filter Type = "Container"
     and EC2InstanceId = "i-0ff43104167024ee8"
| limit 20




###
Group By Container Query for CPU Data:

A query that can gather the maximum CPU usage for a given ContainerName
over a specified time frame.
###

fields @timestamp, Type, ContainerName, CpuUtilized
| filter Type = "Container"
| stats max(CpuUtilized) by ContainerName




###
Specific Container Query for CpuData:

A query that can create graphical views of the CPU stats for
a ContainerName over time since the real-time metric isn't granular
enough.
###

fields @timestamp, Type, ContainerName, CpuUtilized
| filter Type = "Container"
     and ContainerName = "ConsumerBackend"
| stats max(CpuUtilized) by bin(10m)
